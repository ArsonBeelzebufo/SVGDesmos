Not all SVG files will work (at least, for now). The files I used for this were created by converting PNGs to SVGs via a free adobe website (adobe.com/express/feature/image/convert/png-to-svg or adobe.com/express/feature/image/convert/jpg-to-svg) and minified using another website (svgminify.com). Notably, the files created by this website utilize the w3.org/2000/svg xmlns. They also contain paths consisting purely of cubic Bezier curves. Whether or not this will be updated to support more SVGs more generally (or other file types, maybe) is as of right now entirely up in the air, as this whole thing is a quick helper made to facilitate a class project assignment.

To use this program, put your formatted svg file in the same directory as the main.py file. Then, simply run the python script. It will ask you provide a file path (which will typically just be the file name). It will print to console the upper bound for t (in Desmos, limit t to the closed interval from 0 to whatever value the program prints), and create or replace two files (color.txt and eq.txt) that contain the pastable equation lists for the color and the vector paths. Once these are pasted, select the color for the vector path to be the custom color defined by the color list, set to fill, and set opacity to 1 and line width to 0.
